# Projects Using Python and OpenCV

Welcome to my repository showcasing various projects developed using Python and the OpenCV library. These projects highlight my skills in image processing and computer vision. Below, you will find a brief overview of each project.

## Projects

### 1. Lane Detection
In this project, I developed an advanced lane detection system for autonomous vehicles. The system accurately identifies lane markings and provides real-time feedback to the vehicle's control system.

### 2. Object Detection with YOLO
Utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, this project demonstrates real-time object detection capabilities. It can detect and classify multiple objects in an image or video stream efficiently.

### 3. Facial Recognition
This project involves creating a facial recognition system that can identify and verify individuals from a given dataset. The system uses advanced machine learning techniques for high accuracy and reliability.

### 4. Image Filtering and Enhancement
A collection of various image filtering and enhancement techniques, including edge detection, noise reduction, and histogram equalization. These techniques improve the quality and clarity of images for better analysis and interpretation.
